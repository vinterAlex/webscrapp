If you miss any libraries just use `pip install library_name` --> example: `pip install pandas`

Getting the text you want, open dev tools in browser and search for HTML specific field where is located.

### TO DO:

* automatically install libraries that are needed
* create csv file from Pandas in a specific folder
* work on some values inside file (`stoc`) --> typo issues on writing
* more will come...
